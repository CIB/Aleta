## How to interact with thinking models?

1. Use the "creativity" of thinking models to generate a list of possible relevant thoughts and examples
2. But instead of letting the thinking model ramble on, pull structured data out of the output, for example a list of ideas, a list of entities, relations between entities, etc.
3. Construct a "concept search tree" from the output, for example with the QwQ-32B thinking model, the "but wait" could be understood as a signal to switch to a different branch of the tree
4. Use external tooling and subroutines to evaluate parts of the output, and use the results to guide the thought process
