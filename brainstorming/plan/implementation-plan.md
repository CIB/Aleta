# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Functionality

1. **Basic Tree Structure Implementation**

   - Create core tree structure with typed nodes
   - Implement node operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Add type validation for nodes
   - Implement path-based node referencing

2. **Function System**

   - Create function definition structure
   - Implement execution context, including function stack
   - Implement basic function execution
   - Add type checking for function inputs/outputs
   - Allow for functions to reference their tree context
   - Implement storing functions in the tree

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Refine LLM templates (currently has prompt, types and examples, we should add constraints and constraint checking)

## Phase 2: Task System

4. **Task Management**

   - Define task node type
   - Create task execution engine
   - Build the task execution stack tree and logging
   - Add subtask creation and management and integrate it into the stack tree
   - Implement context rotation for tasks and consider how it interacts with jobs and their context tuning

5. **Micro-Agent System**
   - Create job execution framework for single tasks
   - Implement step-wise progression
   - Add predefined job handlers, like hypothesis generation/testing etc.
   - Create data collection mechanism for jobs

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

6. **Recipe System**

   - Implement recipe storage and execution
   - Add recipe refinement capabilities
   - Create recipe-task transformation
   - Implement recipe versioning

7. **Introspection System**
   - Create execution logging
   - Implement issue detection
   - Add human intervention points
   - Create automatic correction mechanisms

## Phase 4: Tooling and UI

8. **Development Tools**

   - Create interactive web client
   - Implement tree visualization
   - Add debugging tools
   - Create task monitoring interface

9. **Integration Features**

   - Implement external API integration and work it into the tree
   - Add external entity representation in the tree that can interact with external APIs
   - Represent projects (like a tool to start a horde worker for example) in the tree
   - Represent codebases directly in the tree (e.g. a python tool to synthesize voice)

10. **Knowledge Management**
    - Implement knowledge base system (wikipedia for our system)
    - Use the above system to store types (like "Docker Container") and recipes (like "How to synthesize a voice")
    - Create personality system using a tree with recursively more detailed descriptions of the personality
